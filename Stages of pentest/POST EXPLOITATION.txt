Things to do after gaining access on a system
look through files
download/upload files
extract passwords
gain access to entire network
run a keylogger== program that captures every key typed

meterpreter commands
system commands
download [filename]== downloads file
upload [filename]== upload file to target
rm == delete file
mkdir == create folder
arp == displays hosts arp cache
netstat == prints out all the connection
execute == allows to execute diff command simultaneously
execute -f [program e.g. calc]
ps== lists out all process currently running on a target
kill == terminate a running program
help == show help menu


UI commands
mouse==
running keylogger==keyscan_start to start capturing



Elevating privileges

search for the privilege escalation exploits
***search bypassauc == user account control
use exploit for target
set options
run to get a new session but with user account turned off

OR search the current year modules
find local exploit == can be used only on target
always make sure listening port for privilege escalation is different from the listening port for the session


CREATING PERSISTENCE
A module that allows us to stay on a target machine even after system gets reboot
part of maintaining access
search persistence
use persistence_service
privilege escalation is required for it to work
set options
after reboot
set the listener for the persistence module


USEFUL COMMANDS IN POST EXPLOIT
search == look for a specific file type
search -f *.filetype == extract all filetype located on a system
search post/systmtype == search for post exploitation module for sys type
search files
search hashdump
clearev == clear event log on a target... requires system privilege
