Exploitation and Gaining Access
10.0.2.5
linus metasploit
outdated software version
open ports
vulnerable software on a port

exploit: using its vulnerability to send something called payload
payload/shell: a program delivered to the target after the exploit.
it allows us to execute command on target system and navigates through
files and folders.

1)exploit>>send payload>>execute command.


METASPLOIT FRAMEWORK
***as long as a software has an open port, it's open to possible exploitation


a found bug in a code gets a name and the year it first occured
a vulnerability that exists and has not been patched yet is called zero day

****vulnerability don't always have to be technical



REVERSE SHELLS/PAYLOAD AND BIND SHELLS

Reverse shell== works on principle of target machine trying to connect
back to our machine...
for this to work on our machine, we must first listen for the incoming
connection over some port.
then we exploit the target and drop a shell to the target machine to connect
to the listening machine
after connection completes, we can control machine

BIND SHELL== the target machine opens their port to connect to.
the target machine is the listening machine, we have to connect to it
then control

CON with bind shell
firewall can forbid target machine to open port

however reverse shell will always work... why?
becaue the target is just connecting to us on a port like visiting a webpage



METASPLOIT FRAMEWORK  METASPLOIT FRAMEWORK  METASPLOIT FRAMEWORK

offers thousands of modules for almost all OS
cd /usr/share/metasploit-framework/
msfconsole== metasploit progam...[just type msfconsole on the terminal]

msfvenom== used to generate shells

MODULES
ls
cd modules/auxilliary/
auxilliary modules: it does not execute a payload like exploits. its used to
perform different actions such as scanning, fuzzing, or DOS attacks.
can sometimes be used in first two stages of pentesting.
there are a lot of them that perform vulnnerability scanning and
fingerprinting.



cd modules/exploits/
cd modules/post/


cd modules/payloads/
payload modules: singles, stagers, stages
single payloads: payloads that are completely standalone
stagers payloads: payloads that setup a connection between an attacker and victim, and are designed to be small and reliable
stages payloads: payload components that are downloaded by stagers modules

meterpreter shell
two things to connect in a payload
1) reverse_tcp connection and meterpreter shell



cd modules/encoders/
encoders helps to evade antivirus detection by encoding and less detectable

cd /nops: no operation...



MSFCONSOLE
usage; type msfconsole, might take a while to start for the first time.
help-- to view help
search =version exploit
show [module]===show items
use module--show info
set info
RHOSTS== receiving host or target host
RPORT== receiving port[default]
LHOST== listening address
LPORT== default
show target == exploitable target with a payload
exploit== run payload
exit== exit payload
